# Microservice Deployment: vFunction Refactoring Engine for AWS Workshop

## Introduction

vFunction Refactoring Engine and vFunction Architectural Observability Manager provide a full end-to-end modernization solution that helps architects find and fix technical debt, build a domain-based design architecture, and the decompose the application into microservices to efficiently deploy on to AWS architecture using best practices such as the Strangler Fig Pattern. The vFunction continuous modernization platform analyzes architectures and enables architects to automate application modernization and re-architect their Java and .NET applications into microservices, functions, or more modular apps on AWS cloud native infrastructure.

In this workshop, we will cover how to efficiently decompose monolithic apps into microservices, functions, or modular services, and then how to safely stage, migrate, and deploy those microservice applications onto AWS environments, so enterprises can breathe new life into their complex applications, and refactor old code for new cloud environments.

The vFunction platform has two modules:

1. **Architectural Observability (AO):** for analyzing the applications and continuously monitor and handle architectural debt and drifts. A separate workshop is available for Architectural Observability. 

2. **Refactoring Engine (RE):** automation to **create services** corresponding to the functional domains specified in the AO module as independent software components. This workshop.

### How to do this Workshop?

Start by setting up your environment by completing the **[Setup Environment](/10_setup.html)** section.

**Optionally** complete the **[AO Tutorial](https://awsworkshop.io/)** - a hands-on tutorial for the Architectural Observability module

Then extract services corresponding to the domains specified in the AO Module, complete the **[RE Tutorial](/200_refactoring-engine.html)**.

To delete the resources created in the setup, make sure to do the **[Cleanup](/300_cleanup.html)** section when you're done.

To flip pages use the right and left arrows at the sides of the main frame.

Use the left frame for content navigation and search.

### To benefit the most from this workshop, you should know:

- Basic Java (we will use Eclipse for coding).
- Basic UNIX commands.
- Basic AWS concepts.
