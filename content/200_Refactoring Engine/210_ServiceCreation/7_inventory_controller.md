### Inventory Controller

InventoryController is similar to OrderController, but it uses [Apache Geode](https://geode.apache.org/), so we will need to use one of the profiles defined in the original application for that.

1. Go to the InventoryController project in your IDE, and perform the steps described in section [Config Data Source](/200_refactoring-engine/210_servicecreation/5_db_config.html)

2. To set the service port (the default port 8080 has been taken by OrderController), open the application.properties file and add the property *server.port=8081*

3. In addition, add the property *spring.profiles.active=local* so the GemFire will be used locally. You can view the profile in the file spring-config.xml.

4. Open the file src/main/java/com/oms/inventorycontroller/InventoryControllerApp.java and add the annotation ```@EntityScan(basePackages = { "com.oms.entity" })``` with the required import to the application class as you did for [Order Controller](/200_refactoring-engine/210_servicecreation/6_order_controller.html) 

5. Compile and run InventoryController as you did for [Order Controller](/200_refactoring-engine/210_servicecreation/6_order_controller.html) 

6. Open Postman and review and run the requests under the Inventory folder (OMS Services collection). Note that the request Get Inventory Item Generated EP is sent to the entry point generated by code-copy (see com.vfunction.oms.inventorycontroller.InventoryServiceController).
