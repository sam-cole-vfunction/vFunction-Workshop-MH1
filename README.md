## Description

vFunction Refactoring Engine and vFunction Architectural Observability Manager provide a full end-to-end modernization solution that helps architects find and fix technical debt, build a domain-based design architecture, and the decompose the application into microservices to efficiently deploy on to AWS architecture using best practices such as the Strangler Fig Pattern. The vFunction continuous modernization platform analyzes architectures and enables architects to automate application modernization and re-architect their Java and .NET applications into microservices, functions, or more modular apps on AWS cloud native infrastructure. 

In this workshop, we will cover how to efficiently decompose monolithic apps into microservices, functions, or modular services, and then how to safely stage, migrate, and deploy those microservice applications onto AWS environments, so enterprises can breathe new life into their complex applications, and refactor old code for new cloud environments.
